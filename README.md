# Project-Which-Debts-Are-Worth-the-Bank-s-Effort-

The bank has implemented different recovery strategies at different thresholds ($1000, $2000, etc.) where the greater the expected recovery amount, the more effort the bank puts into contacting the customer. For low recovery amounts (Level 0), the bank just adds the customer's contact information to their automatic dialer and emailing system. For higher recovery strategies, the bank incurs more costs as they leverage human resources in more efforts to obtain payments. Each additional level of recovery strategy requires an additional $50 per customer so that customers in the Recovery Strategy Level 1 cost the company $50 more than those in Level 0. Customers in Level 2 cost $50 more than those in Level 1, etc.

The big question: does the extra amount that is recovered at the higher strategy level exceed the extra $50 in costs? In other words, was there a jump (also called a "discontinuity") of more than $50 in the amount recovered at the higher strategy level? We'll find out in this notebook.
